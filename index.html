2018 (First Half) Japan: Best-Selling Car Brands and Models
July 5, 2018 by Henk Bekker in Japan

During the first semester of 2018 Toyota remained Japan’s largest carmaker despite loosing market share. The Nissan Note was Japan’s top-selling car model.

</P>During the first quarter of 2018, Toyota remained by far the largest carmaker in Japan. However, Toyota sales were down by over 9% compared to a 2.3% contraction for the general market. Honda and Nissan also had weaker sales. Lexus regained the title as best-selling luxury car brand in Japan. The Nissan Note was again the top-selling car model but Honda sold more of the N-Box mini car. </br>

There were no rank position changes in the top ten vehicle manufacturers in Japan during the first semester of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017. Toyota comfortably remained Japan’s top carmaker but lost market share with sales down by 9.2%.<br><br><br><br>
